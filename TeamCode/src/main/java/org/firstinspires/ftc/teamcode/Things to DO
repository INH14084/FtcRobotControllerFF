Need to Do
- attach camera to robot
- create autonomous programs
- make others work on coding
- continue documenting anything and everything robotics related (even seemingly simple / intuitive things)
- create 2 teleop programs, red and blue side
-


Should Do
- Look into getting powerful servos (Add ability to change claw arm yaw angle without turning robot)
- Look into designing an intake mechanism to make game element collection easier / more streamlined
- Collaborate with other teams
- Fundraising
- Invest in team 3d printer / cnc machine (or alternatively look into getting school (board) to purchase for use in cad class and robotics)
    - may talk to mr walker or try to fix printer in mr johnson's room
-Look into training tensor flow with team scoring element

*****
- Look into other awards that can advance us out of qualifying tournements to get to state / world competitons
*****

Would Like to Do
- get in touch with Twin Lakes FRC team to look at what the larger robots look like
-


Not Currently Important Things to Do
- Dead Wheels for RoadRunner code (look up roadrunner, useful for autonomous when no terrain / obstacles on field)
    - requires purchasing encoders
-
