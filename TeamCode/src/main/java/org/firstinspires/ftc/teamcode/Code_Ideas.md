Autonomous Ideas
    -Use gyro to know when moving over barrier
        -Do something once gyro points down to level, to know robot has fully cleared barrier
    -Camera to detect duck placement on barcode
        -Need to add tape to field to test camera and TensorFlow
        -Implement Vuforia and TensorFlow into code
    -Potentially use info from servos to know if claw has grabbed object
        -Needs testing, unknown if servo actually read current angle and wanted angle
